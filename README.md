## Todos before starting the app:

1. Install dependencies for Web Api(check NuGet package manager).
2. If there is the file `package-lock.json` remove it before doing the next step.
3. Install dependencies for React: Jump to the ClientApp directory and run `npm install` in your terminal.

### Info

I modified the file `package.json` but the original version of this file is `package copy.json` in case you want to install all dependencies came with React inside ASP .Net Core.
